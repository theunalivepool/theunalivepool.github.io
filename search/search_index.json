The installation instructions are pretty standard and covered here. A quick command is as below pip install -U hiplot # Or for conda users: conda install -c conda-forge hiplot First look at the data in a jupyter notebook chicks = pd.read_csv('chickweight.csv') # get the chicks :D import hiplot as hip data = chicks.to_dict(orient='records') # this transforms the chicks into a data dictionary.. hip.Experiment.from_iterable(data).display() # Stating the obvious About the dataset : dataset that has weight measures of chicks for 21 days after they are born given a specific diet The columns of the data_frame are the vertical axes, and given that these axes representing co-ordinates are parallel to each other, ergo, parallel co-ordinates . We'll just re-arrange the dataset so that we understand this a tad bit better and know what, how and where to look for We move the Chick column as the first column (this is chick_id ), followed by Diet , as this is a different feed to the chickens, and our target variable is the weight of the chicks, which comes to the last, which leaves the time columns as the third one. This gives us the following ordering. Stating the Not so obvious The first numerical column in the dataset is used for coloring . For our case, it was weight , which is also our target variable, so we don't really need to explicitly set it. This parallel co-ordinates view would have automatically handled categorical variable of Diet . You can easily mark a variable categorical if need be(just right-click on the column text at top). Free Stuff Outlier Detection(Multi-dimensional, yes!) At a glance, one can see that the extreme weights of chicks are in the range >300 . Selecting records will highlight the row and associated values of different columns. An added advantage is, you could see the multi-dimensional outliers in a glance here. You can exclude them, by just clicking on the Exclude button and the plot would re-scale if needed Helping us ask the questions It does not take a very fine eye to note the following for the last 2 variables - Time and Weight The weight of the chickens do seem to increase w/ time (given the lines look parallel to each other w.r.t time) and the change in color We also observe there is an increase in variance as the time increases. We could confirm this by looking at time vs weight plot. Guess what, you can do it right here!! Multi-Variate Relationships A very powerful thing that we can do is, we can select a window of one or more column and observe the association w/ target variable. Here, we obviously ask, for a set of 2 different diets say Diet 2 , and Diet 3 , how does the weight of chickens change with respect to time window of days? . Here, we first color by Diet variable to get a sense of differentiation b/w two diets. Select the Diet we wish to compare, and simply, select the rolling timeframe We move the weight axes now in the center , to observe the growth of chicken w/ time. The following view, then allows us to think in the direction that Diet 3 fosters more growth than Diet 2 Additional Features Export as interactive html : One can easily export this as a standalone html to explore the dataset using just the csv. You can even share the html offline. The command for the same is hiplot-render chickweight.csv > chickweight.html DataFrame Access : It's easy to get lost in plots and charts, and a lot of us tend to stick to tables. There is searchable dataframe right below the plot to enable access the entire dataframe content right at the bottom. Variable Transformation :Hi-Plot visual allows us to do few very useful transformations on the fly, including b/w types(categorical, numerical, timestamp) and Scale - (Log, Percentiles) Limitations and Things to Note If you took a note above(Multi-variate - relationships), we did center the weight axis and had the Time and Diet around it. This was for the purpose that it is easier to identify relationships b/w adjoining columns, and it gets difficult as we move away from the columns. This view will definitely help us to get started w/ discovering the story, but might not necessarily help us have an exhaustive view. A good example of that is that we did miss the fact that some chickens in the above dataset prematurely died Another thing to note, that discovering the order in which to view data might need a few iterations and might not be very obvious for a dataset having a lot of features. Do give a read to wiki for better usage from the parallel coordinates view.

This information should be useful when solving the problem Other Notes Q: What is an optimization problem? The goal of optimization is to find the best solution to a problem out of a large set of possible solutions. (Sometimes you'll be satisfied with finding any feasible solution; OR-Tools can do that as well.) Optimization problems have the following elements: The objective \u2014the quantity you want to optimize. To set up an optimization problem, you need to define a function that calculates the value of the objective for any possible solution. This is called the objective function. An optimal solution is one for which the value of the objective function is the best. (\"Best\" can be either a maximum or a minimum.) constraints \u2014restrictions on the set of possible solutions, based on the specific requirements of the problem. A feasible solution is one that satisfies all the given constraints for the problem, without necessarily being optimal. The first step in solving an optimization problem is identifying the objective and constraints. Q: Types of Optimisation problems Linear optimization : linear optimization problem is one in which the objective function and the constraints are linear expressions in the variables Constraint optimization : Constraint optimization, or constraint programming (CP), identifies feasible solutions out of a very large set of candidates, where the problem can be modeled in terms of arbitrary constraints . CP is based on feasibility (finding a feasible solution) rather than optimization (finding an optimal solution) and focuses on the constraints and variables rather than the objective function . However, CP can be used to solve optimization problems, simply by comparing the values of the objective function for all feasible solutions. Mixed-integer optimization : A mixed integer optimization problem is one in which some or all of the variables are required to be integers. An example would be : the variable can take only 0 or 1 value in the context of an assigment problem, in which a group of workers needs be assigned to a set of tasks Bin packing : Bin packing is the problem of packing a set of objects of different sizes into containers with different capacities . The goal is to pack as many of the objects as possible, subject to the capacities of the containers. A special case of this is the knapsack problem, in which there is just one container. Network flows : Many optimization problems can be represented by a directed graph consisting of nodes and directed arcs between them . For example, transportation problems, in which goods are shipped across a railway network, can be represented by a graph in which the arcs are rail lines and the nodes are distribution centers. In the maximum flow problem, each arc has a maximum capacity that can be transported across it. The problem is to assign the amount of goods to be shipped across each arc so that the total quantity being transported is as large as possible. Assignment : Assignment problems involve assigning a group of agents (say, workers or machines) to a set of tasks, where there is a fixed cost for assigning each agent to a specific task. The problem is to find the assignment with the least total cost. Assignment problems are actually a special case of network flow problems. Scheduling : Scheduling problems involve assigning resources to perform a set of tasks at specific times. An important example is the job shop problem, in which multiple jobs are processed on several machines. Each job consists of a sequence of tasks, which must be performed in a given order, and each task must be processed on a specific machine. The problem is to assign a schedule so that all jobs are completed in as short an interval of time as possible. Routing : Routing problems involve finding the optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse a network, defined by a directed graph.","title":"Overview and Graph Coloring"},{"location":"Active%20Threads/optimisation/Overview%20and%20Graph%20Coloring/#overview-and-graph-coloring","text":"","title":"Overview and Graph Coloring"},{"location":"Active%20Threads/optimisation/Overview%20and%20Graph%20Coloring/#glossary","text":"Graph Density = # of edges in graph/ # of possible edges in a graph Max # of possible edges in graph = V*(V-1)/2 for an undirected graph where V - # of vertices","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"Active%20Threads/optimisation/Overview%20and%20Graph%20Coloring/#hints","text":"For the graph coloring problem: the higher the degree of node, higher the node is constrained.
