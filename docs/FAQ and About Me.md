# FAQ and About Me!

Also known as frequently asked questions.

### Who are you? and what is this assortment of notes?

I am Ronak Agrawal. I enjoy structuring stuff and identifying hierarchies. This
website is an attempt to just do the same for my learnings, experiences and
share w/ whosoever is interested.

### Who is the target audience?

Like I said, whosoever is interested.   
I know for sure, a future version of me will definitely be interested. This is
as raw as it gets.   
Also, a couple of close friends and family to whom I will deliberately pass this
link!.

### What is the update frequency? and How long do you think you can keep this up?

Don't know. For now, I just hope I stay consistent :). I can always come back
after a pause(the comment is more for me, than for you!). For now, I am not
putting pressure on myself. Let's see how it goes.

### How do we reach you?

If you want to reach (I don't know why you would want to, but sure!), send the
message to _ronakagrawal2006@gmail.com_.
