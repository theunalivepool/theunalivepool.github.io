# Publishing Workflow

## Motivation
For me to remember how to publish changes. I tend to forget a lot of workflow related processes.

## Steps:

1. Make changes in a `*.md` file (Either by creating new or making changes in an
   existing one.)
2. Run `mkdocs gh-deploy`
3. Open [this](https://unalivepool.github.io/) ,inspect -> Empty cache and hard
   reload

## Questions:

* When do I choose if I should make a file vs folder?
* What is the impact of creating a folder?
* Refresher resources?
* When do I push a commit to main?
* What does it mean to push or pull from gh-pages?
