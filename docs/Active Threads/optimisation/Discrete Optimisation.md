# Discrete Optimisation

## Motivation:

I did implement a discount allocator at a previous organisation w/ an objective
of optimising discounts. While it was a sensible product and did serve the
purpose it was created for, I felt there were some gaps on the background that I
needed to cover.  
So, here I am trying to establish my understanding and learning through a
structured course in a dedicated time setting.

## Outcome and Output:

For the next few weeks(starting 21-Nov), I'll be publishing all my learnings(
hopefully) and experiences here.

## Status
* **Start State**: As of 21-Nov-21, I have completed W2(took time of around 
  3-weeks),
  and have watched the videos/lectures of W3. I am now trying to work my way
  through assignment of W3. 

## ToDo 
* Learning so far from W2
