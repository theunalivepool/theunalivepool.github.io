<h4 id="q-what-is-an-optimization-problem">Q: What is an optimization problem?</h4>
<p>The goal of optimization is to find the best solution to a problem out of a large set of possible solutions.
(Sometimes you'll be satisfied with finding any feasible solution; OR-Tools can do that as well.)</p>
<p>Optimization problems have the following elements:</p>
<p>The <strong>objective</strong>—the quantity you want to optimize. To set up an optimization problem, you need to define a function
that calculates the value of the objective for any possible solution. This is called the objective function.</p>
<p>An optimal solution is one for which the value of the objective function is the best. ("Best" can be either a maximum or
a minimum.)</p>
<p><strong>constraints</strong>—restrictions on the set of possible solutions, based on the specific requirements of the problem.</p>
<p>A feasible solution is one that satisfies all the given constraints for the problem, without necessarily being optimal.
The first step in solving an optimization problem is identifying the objective and constraints.</p>
<h4 id="q-types-of-optimisation-problems">Q: Types of Optimisation problems</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linear optimization</strong>:  linear optimization problem is one in which the objective function and the constraints are
  linear expressions in the variables</li>
<li><strong>Constraint optimization</strong>: Constraint optimization, or constraint programming (CP), <strong>identifies feasible
  solutions</strong> out of a very large set of candidates, where the <strong>problem</strong> <strong>can be modeled in terms of arbitrary
  constraints</strong>. CP is <strong>based on feasibility</strong> (finding a feasible solution) rather than optimization (finding an
  optimal solution) and <strong>focuses on the constraints and variables rather than the objective function</strong>. However, CP can
  be used to solve optimization problems, simply by comparing the values of the objective function for all feasible
  solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Mixed-integer optimization</strong>: A mixed integer optimization problem is one in which some or all of the variables are
  required to be integers. An example would be : the variable can take only 0 or 1 value in the context of an
  <strong>assigment</strong> problem, in which a group of workers needs be assigned to a set of tasks</li>
<li><strong>Bin packing</strong>: Bin packing is the problem of <strong>packing a set of objects of different sizes into containers with
  different capacities</strong>. The goal is to pack as many of the objects as possible, subject to the capacities of the
  containers. A special case of this is the knapsack problem, in which there is just one container.</li>
<li><strong>Network flows</strong>: Many optimization problems can be represented by a <strong>directed graph consisting of nodes and
  directed arcs between them</strong>. For example, transportation problems, in which goods are shipped across a railway
  network, can be represented by a graph in which the arcs are rail lines and the nodes are distribution centers. In the
  maximum flow problem, each arc has a maximum capacity that can be transported across it. The problem is to assign the
  amount of goods to be shipped across each arc so that the total quantity being transported is as large as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Assignment</strong>: Assignment problems involve assigning a group of agents (say, workers or machines) to a set of tasks,
  where there is a fixed cost for assigning each agent to a specific task. The problem is to find the assignment with
  the least total cost. Assignment problems are actually a special case of network flow problems.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduling</strong>: Scheduling problems involve assigning resources to perform a set of tasks at specific times. An
  important example is the job shop problem, in which multiple jobs are processed on several machines. Each job consists
  of a sequence of tasks, which must be performed in a given order, and each task must be processed on a specific
  machine. The problem is to assign a schedule so that all jobs are completed in as short an interval of time as
  possible.</li>
<li><strong>Routing</strong>: Routing problems involve finding the optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse a network,
  defined by a directed graph. </li>
