                <h1 id="hiplot-better-parallel-co-ordinates">HiPlot - Better Parallel Co-ordinates</h1>
<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/hiplot/">HiPlot</a> is a <strong>very-light interactive</strong> visualisation tool by <strong>Facebook AI 
Research</strong> that allows you to view n-dimensional relationships in a 2 D view and was released very recently.  </p>
<p>While parallel co-ordinates is not a new methodology, and has been around figuratively for more than a century -
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_coordinates">1885</a>, the Key Benefits IMO are listed as below.</p>
<h2 id="key-benefits">Key benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Interactivity</strong> - highly customisable and fast</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Zoom in or Zoom out on the dataset - by selecting a particular set of points to <strong>Keep</strong> and to <strong>Exclude</strong>
  respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Able to visually transform scales to log-scale and percentile scales</p>
</li>
<li>Select color axis</li>
<li>Re-order columns in column axis (should help in discovery of relationships/corr. b/w variables)</li>
<li>Scale - Able to handle interactivity w/ around <strong>half a million data points w/o getting sluggish</strong></li>
<li><strong>Looks pretty</strong> and not dull!!! /\</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, <strong>discovering the story</strong> (assuming you have all the characters) or <strong>EDA</strong> became a lot easier</p>
<p>Let us build a narrative together and explore the <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.
org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/ChickWeight">chicken weight dataset</a> to just see what all can we do.</p>
<p>The installation instructions are pretty standard and covered here. A quick command is as below  </p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">pip install -U hiplot  # Or for conda users: conda install -c conda-forge hiplot
</code></pre>
<h2 id="first-look-at-the-data-in-a-jupyter-notebook">First look at the data in a jupyter notebook</h2>
<pre><code class="language-python">chicks = pd.read_csv('chickweight.csv')  # get the chicks :D
import hiplot as hip

data = chicks.to_dict(orient='records')  # this transforms the chicks into a data dictionary..
hip.Experiment.from_iterable(data).display()  #
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="img.png" src="../../img.png" /></p>
<h3 id="stating-the-obvious">Stating the obvious</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>About the dataset</strong>: dataset that has weight measures of chicks for 21 days after they are born given a specific
  diet</li>
<li>The columns of the <strong>data_frame</strong> are the vertical axes, and given that these axes representing co-ordinates are
  parallel to each other, ergo, <strong>parallel co-ordinates</strong>.</li>
<li>We'll just re-arrange the dataset so that we understand this a tad bit better and know what, how and where to look for</li>
<li>We move the <code>Chick</code> column as the first column (this is <strong>chick_id</strong>), followed by <code>Diet</code> , as this is a different
  feed to the chickens, and our <strong>target variable</strong> is the <code>weight</code> of the chicks, which comes to the last, which leaves
  the <code>time</code>  columns as the third one. This gives us the following ordering.
  <img alt="img_1.png" src="../../img_1.png" /></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stating-the-not-so-obvious">Stating the Not so obvious</h3>
<ul>
<li>The first <strong>numerical</strong> column in the dataset is used for <strong>coloring</strong>. For our case, it was <code>weight</code>, which is also
  our target variable, so we don't really need to explicitly set it.</li>
<li>This parallel co-ordinates view would have automatically handled <strong>categorical</strong> variable of <code>Diet</code>. You can easily
  mark a variable categorical if need be(just right-click on the column text at top).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="free-stuff">Free Stuff</h2>
<h3 id="outlier-detectionmulti-dimensional-yes">Outlier Detection(Multi-dimensional, yes!)</h3>
<ul>
<li>At a glance, one can see that the extreme weights of chicks are in the <strong>range &gt;300</strong>.</li>
<li>Selecting records will highlight the row and associated values of different columns.
  <img alt="img_3.png" src="../../8.gif" /></li>
<li>An added advantage is, you could see the multi-dimensional outliers in a glance here.</li>
<li>You can <strong>exclude</strong> them, by just clicking on the <strong>Exclude</strong> button and the plot would <strong>re-scale</strong> if needed</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="helping-us-ask-the-questions">Helping us ask the questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>It does not take a very fine eye to note the following for the last 2 variables - <code>Time</code> and <code>Weight</code><ul>
<li>The <strong>weight</strong> of the chickens do seem to <strong>increase w/ time</strong> (given the lines look parallel to each other w.r.t
  time) and the change in color</li>
<li>We also observe there is an <strong>increase in variance</strong> as the time increases. We could confirm this by looking at
  time vs weight plot. Guess what, you can do it right here!!
  <img alt="img_4.png" src="../../10.gif" /></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multi-variate-relationships">Multi-Variate Relationships</h3>
<ul>
<li>A very powerful thing that we can do is, we can select a window of one or more column and observe the association w/
  target variable.</li>
<li>Here, we obviously ask, for a set of 2 different diets say <strong>Diet 2</strong>, and <strong>Diet 3</strong>, <strong>how does the weight of
  chickens change with respect to time window of days?</strong>.<ul>
<li>Here, we first <strong>color by Diet</strong> variable to get a sense of differentiation b/w two diets.</li>
<li>Select the <code>Diet</code> we wish to compare, and simply, select the rolling timeframe</li>
<li>We move the <strong>weight axes now in the center</strong>, to observe the growth of chicken w/ time.</li>
<li>The following view, then allows us to think in the direction that <strong>Diet 3</strong> fosters more growth than <strong>Diet 2</strong>
  <img alt="img_3.png" src="../../12.gif" /></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="additional-features">Additional Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Export as interactive html</strong>: One can easily export this as a standalone html to explore the dataset using just the
  csv. You can even share the html offline. The command for the same is</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-shell">hiplot-render chickweight.csv &gt; chickweight.html
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>DataFrame Access</strong>: It's easy to get lost in plots and charts, and a lot of us tend to stick to tables. There is
  <strong>searchable dataframe</strong> right below the plot to enable access the entire dataframe content right at the bottom.</li>
<li><strong>Variable Transformation</strong> :Hi-Plot visual allows us to do few very useful transformations on the fly, including b/w
  types(categorical, numerical, timestamp) and Scale - (Log, Percentiles)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="limitations-and-things-to-note">Limitations and Things to Note</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you took a note above(Multi-variate - relationships), we did <strong>center</strong> the weight axis and had the <strong>Time</strong> and
  <strong>Diet</strong> around it. This was for the purpose that it is easier to identify relationships b/w adjoining columns, and it
  gets difficult as we move away from the columns.</li>
<li>This view will definitely help us to get started w/ discovering the story, but might not necessarily help us have an
  exhaustive view. A good example of that is that we did miss the fact that some chickens in the above dataset <strong>
  prematurely died</strong></li>
<li>Another thing to note, that discovering the order in which to view data might need a few iterations and might not be
  very obvious for a dataset having a lot of features. Do give a read to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_coordinates">wiki</a> for better usage from the parallel 
  coordinates view.</li>
